# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### What is scrapping data and why use it?

Scraping data refers to the process of extracting data from websites or other sources using automated software or scripts. It is commonly used for data mining, data analysis, and to gather information for various purposes such as market research, price comparison, and competitor analysis. Scraping data allows for efficient and fast collection of large amounts of information that would be impractical to manually gather.

### How does it work?

Web scraping, or data scraping, is a technique for extracting information from websites. It works by making HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading the HTML of the web page, and then parsing that HTML to extract the data you're interested in. This can be done using libraries or frameworks like BeautifulSoup, Cheerio, or Puppeteer, which provide easy-to-use APIs for traversing and manipulating the HTML. Scraping is commonly used for tasks such as data mining, data analysis, price comparison, sentiment analysis and many more. Scraping allows you to gather data from websites that do not provide an API or data feed, and it can also be used to automate tasks such as data entry, form submissions, and other repetitive tasks.

### What is web crawlers?

A web crawler is a program that visits web pages and follows links on those pages to automatically discover new pages. It is used to index and archive the content of websites for search engines and other applications.

### What is the difference between Web scraping and web crawlers?

Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website, while web crawling refers to the process of automatically visiting multiple web pages to extract data or index the pages for search engines. Web scraping is focused on extracting specific information from a website, while web crawling is focused on visiting and indexing as many pages as possible. Web scraping is typically done using scripts or programs, while web crawling is often done by search engines using specialized software.
